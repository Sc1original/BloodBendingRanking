Bloodbenders with higher ranks can blood bend others with lower rank, but blood benders with lower rank cant blood bend bloodbenders with higher rank, blood benders with equal rank can blood bend each other

Ranks: Amon, Tarlok, Master, Expert
Amon > Tarlok > Master > Expert

examples:
player with Amon rank can blood bend player with Expert rank , player with Expert rank cant blood bend player with Amon rank
player with Expert rank can bloodbend player with Expert rank, and he can too

IMPORTANT NOTE: ENABLE "canBloodbendotherbloodbenders" option on Projectkorra config.yml 

IMPORTANT NOTE: MAKE SURE TO CHECKOUT OPTIONS LIKE "canonlybloodbendonnight" or "canonlybloodbendonfullmoon", example: if its on canbloodbendonnight, both players cant do blood bending if they dont have bending.ability.bloodbending.anytime perm

by default: all the OP players have bending.ability.bloodbending.anytime permission, also they have Amon rank (all ranks are default to op but because of that Amon is higher I said Amon) , 
you can change their permission by plugins like Luckperms,


so for example if u want to make an op player's bloodbendingrank Expert, first make sure to set bloodbendingrank.amon, bloodbendingrank.tarlok and bloodbendingrank.master to false for them, cause default for ops is true
